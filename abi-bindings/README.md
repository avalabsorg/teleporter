## ABI Bindings

This directory contains ABI bindings for the Solidity contracts in the `contracts/src/` directory. The files with the same name as the Solidity source files are automatically generated by the `scripts/abi_bindings.sh` script. 

The `packing.go` files in individual subfolders define utilities for ABI packing instances of structs auto-generated by `abigen` as well as method calls. For structs, the `ABIPacker` interface defined in `./packer/packer.go` needs to be implemented and mapped to its instance added to the `packer_test.go` file to ensure that the tests are exhaustive and don't fail silently if additional fields are added to the structs in the future on the Solidity side.
