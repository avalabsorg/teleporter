## Teleporter Messenger Contract
This directory contains Solidity contracts implementing the Teleporter messaging protocol.

This directory is set up as a [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) project. Use the `scripts/install_foundry.sh` to install the correct version of the ava-labs fork of foundry. Further documentation about given contracts can be found in`src/teleporter/`.

## Building and Running
- To compile the contracts run `forge build` from this directory.
- Similarly, to run unit tests, run `forge test`.
- See additional testing and deployment options [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/).

## Deployment
**Do not deploy using `forge create`**. See [this guide](https://github.com/ava-labs/teleporter/blob/main/utils/contract-deployment/README.md) on how to properly deploy the `TeleporterMessenger` contract to your Subnet.

## Generate documentation
- Documentation can be generated by running `forge doc --build` from this repository. By default, this will generate documentation to `contracts/docs/`, and an HTML book to `contracts/docs/book/`. It's also possible to serve this book locally by running `forge doc --serve <PORT>`.
